This uses the python "keyboard" library. 
Why?:
- I *really* don't want to do multithreading and add on all that complexity
- crossplatform keypressses are gonna be a bit of a pain.
- I mean, it's kinda lightweight
- I once saw a screaming woman get dragged off by three men in the middle of the night and did nothing to stop it.
- I'm going to use keypresses extensively. This saves a lot of time and complexity
- Some default behavior with buffers with input require the enter key, and that doesn't gel with what I'm trying to do. 
this library helps solve that issue. 

This also uses the "rich" library for rich text and formatting in the terminal
Why?
- reduced complexity
- really, just lots of really cool functionality for a prettier terminal

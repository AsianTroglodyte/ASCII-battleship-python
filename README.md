This uses the python "keyboard" library. 
Why?
- I *really* don't want to do multithreading and add on all that complexity
- crossplatform keypressses are gonna be a bit of a pain.
- I'm going to use keypresses extensively. This saves a lot of time and complexity
- Some default behavior with buffers with input require the enter key, and that doesn't gel with what I'm trying to do. 
this library helps solve that issue. 
- I once saw a screaming woman get dragged off by three men in the middle of the night and did nothing to stop it.
